# Follow the instructions in this part of the project. Define and flesh out your function below, 
# which should accept a dictionary as an argument when called, and return a string of the info in 
# that book-dictionary in a user-friendly readable format.

# Code below

# Once you are finished with that function, create several more functions which return individual pieces of information 
# from the book.

# Finally, create at least three new functions that might be useful as we expand our home library app. Perhaps thing of a way 
# you could accept additional arguments when the function is called? Also, imagine you have a list filled with dictionaries like 
# above.
